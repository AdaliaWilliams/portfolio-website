    <h2 class="indexHeader">General Concept</h2>
    <p class="indexContent">The general concept for this website is for the user to have easy access to create any outfit at the touch of their fingertips. When shown all the items of clothing in their closet in an ordered place it would be easier for the user to create any outfit that comes to mind. There are options
    for the user to choose a top and bottom or dress. In the future, if I plan to continue to develop this website, I hope to display the weather forecast for the user to easily choose for the weather. I also hope to allow the user to add
    their own closet to the website so each website would be different for their user. I also hope to have each photograph of an item of clothing to be saved so there are modifications that can be made to each item such as "dirty" or "clean". </p>
